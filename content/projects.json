      "fullDescription": "This project aims to bridge the gap between affordable hardware and modern web interfaces. The Smart Home IoT System is a centralized control hub allowing users to monitor room temperature, humidity, and control lighting remotely. Using the ESP32 microcontroller as the brain, it communicates via WebSockets to a React-based frontend hosted on a local network.",
      "journey": "I started this project because I wanted to turn my room lights on without getting out of bed. It began with a simple LED blink over Wi-Fi. Over three weeks, I learned about the MQTT protocol (though I eventually settled on WebSockets for lower latency on the local network) and how to design a PCB for the relay modules.",
      "journeyImage": "/assets/images/projects/smart-home-journey.jpg",
      "challenges": "The biggest challenge was handling the asynchronous nature of WebSocket messages in C++. I encountered several memory leaks on the ESP32 which caused it to crash after a few hours. Debugging this required me to dive deep into memory management and optimize the JSON parsing libraries I was using.",

      "fullDescription": "An autonomous rover capable of navigating complex indoor environments without human intervention. The robot uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to 'look' around. When it detects an obstacle, it halts, scans left and right, calculates the clearest path, and executes a turn.",
      "journey": "This was my entry into the world of robotics. I sourced the chassis and motors from a local scrap market. The first version simply spun in circles! It took many iterations of tweaking the motor driver logic (L298N) and sensor timing to get it to drive straight.",
      "journeyImage": "/assets/images/projects/robot-journey.jpg",
      "challenges": "Power management was tricky. The motors drew too much current, causing the Arduino to reset. I solved this by isolating the power supplies—one Li-ion battery for the motors and a separate 9V for the logic board.",

      "journey": "After watching a video on how AI 'sees', I had to try it myself. I collected 500 images of fruits and labeled them manually. Training the model on my laptop took hours, heating up the room!",
      "challenges": "The model initially confused yellow apples with bananas. I had to tune the hyperparameters and add more variety to the training data (different lighting conditions) to improve robustness.",
