        "It all started with a kit my parents bought me for my 10th birthday. It was a simple electronics kit with wires, batteries, and LEDs. I remember the first time I completed a circuit and the red light turned on—it felt like magic.",
        "But I quickly wanted more. I wanted the light to blink on its own. I wanted motors to spin based on sensors. That's when I discovered Arduino.",
        "The transition from simple electronics to programmable microcontrollers was steep. I had to learn C++. I had to understand variables, loops, and logic. My first few codes were copy-pasted, but slowly I began to understand the syntax.",
        "My first major build was the Obstacle Avoiding Robot. It was frustrating. Wires kept coming loose, the code had bugs, and the batteries would die. But the moment it autonomously turned away from a wall for the first time, all the frustration vanished.",
        "Robotics has taught me patience. It has taught me that failure is just a data point. Every time something doesn't work, I learn one way how NOT to do it. And that is the essence of engineering."
